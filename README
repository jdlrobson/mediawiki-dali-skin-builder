Making skins in MediaWiki shouldn't require a degree in PHP.

Dali makes the skin making process a lot easier for frontend engineers.

Run `npm install` and `npm start`.
Edit the files in the `src` folder and watch your changes appear before your eyes.

When your skin is ready for distribution run `npm run build`.
This will create a folder in the output folder.
Move the folder into your MediaWiki skins folder - and your new skin is born!
